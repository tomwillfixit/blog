## What is shipitCon ?

shipitCon is a community event for engineers involved in the building and deployment of software. The name is subject to change. 

## Do we really need another conference ?

The fields of Release Management and Build Engineering are becoming increasingly popular as organizations strive to reduce the time taken to deliver new features.  While many conferences may touch on topics such as Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Release Management we will make these topics our focus. 

## When is shipitCon ?

We are planning to host the conference at the end of August 2017.  We are working on confirming a venue and specific date.

## Where is shipitCon ?

We will be hosting the conference in Dublin, Ireland.

## Who are the organisers ?

shipitCon is being organised primarily by engineers working within the games industry.  We are passionate about games and continuously delivering great gaming experiences to our customers.  Continuous Enjoyment.

## Why are you doing this ?

We would like to share our experiences of Release and Build Engineering with other engineers in different industries and learn about how they are evolving to deliver better quality software more regularly. 

## Talks

Initially we will work with our sponsors to generate content for the conference. We will have talks from engineers at Demonware, Digit Gaming, Workday and InterCom.  While we will source talks primarily from the gaming sector we will ensure that content is balanced and relevant to a wider audience.

## Sponsors

We have confirmed the sponsorship of Demonware (Activision) and Digit Gaming.  We will release details of sponsorship packages in the near future. 

## Contact

This conference is in the very early stages (1 week old) and we could use plenty of help to get this up and running.  If you would like to be involved, suggest a talk, sponsor or just provide moral support then feel free to contact @tomwillfixit on Twitter or email : releasecon@tomwillfixit.com
